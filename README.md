# Bulls-and-Cows
A tricky word game played in the console where users are given 10 attempts at guessing a 5-letter isogram based on the number of correct letters in the correct positions (Bulls) and number of correct letters but in the wrong positions (Cows) they receive after each guess.

By including classes, loops, exceptions, libraries, data structures and other fundamentals, this game proved to be a solid self-intro to C++.
