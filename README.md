# Bulls-and-Cows
A tricky word game played in the console where users have a given number of attempts at guessing an isogram based on the number of correct letters in the correct positions (Bulls) and number of correct letters but in the wrong positions (Cows) they guess after each attempt. Based off the popular game, Mastermind. 

By including classes, maps, loops, enumerations, libraries, a header file and other fundamentals, this game proved to be a solid intro to C++. 

Program is coded under Unreal coding standards (int32, FString, FText,etc) as practice for coding with the Unreal game engine.
