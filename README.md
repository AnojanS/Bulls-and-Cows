# Bulls-and-Cows
A tricky word game played in the console where users attempt to reveal a random isogram given the number of correct letters in the correct positions (Bulls) and number of correct letters but in the wrong positions (Cows) they guess after each attempt. Users are given a certain number of attempts dependant on the difficulty of the isogram they recieve. Based off the popular game, Mastermind. 

By including classes, maps, loops, enumerations, libraries, a header file and other fundamentals, this game served as an introductory test of C++. Program is coded under Unreal coding standards (int32, FString, FText,etc) as practice for coding with the Unreal Engine.

To launch, run main.cpp in command prompt.
